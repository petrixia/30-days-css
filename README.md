ðŸš€ 30 Days of CSS ðŸš€

Hello Devs, how's it going? 

30 Days of CSS3 is a challenge aimed at helping you improve your coding skills by working on daily mini-projects using HTML5 and CSS3.

Objective
30 Days of CSS3 is a challenge that I'm going to take on (and you can join too) starting from July 20th, 2020. The goal is to enhance my skills in HTML5 and CSS3 by completing projects.

If you've just arrived and want to start the challenge, feel free to do so. The challenge doesn't have a fixed start date, everyone can choose their own 30 days. I would be honored to have you participate ðŸ˜‰

General Rules
